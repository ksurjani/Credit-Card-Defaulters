The dataset for this project is sourced from a credit card company and includes a range of attributes related to customer demographics, credit card usage, and payment history. Key categorical variables in the dataset are gender, education, and marital status, while continuous variables encompass monthly payments, bill amounts, and default payment status.

The primary objective is to analyze and predict customer default behavior using machine learning models. By identifying patterns and correlations within the data, the project aims to enhance decision-making processes in credit risk assessment. This comprehensive dataset enables the application of advanced data processing techniques and predictive modeling to accurately forecast defaults and improve risk management strategies.
